# ping-bot

How to use this bot

# Installing python

Its simple af
You can go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install the latest version and thats it!

# Inviting the bot
Create an application on https://discord.com/developers/applications
Click on Bots and make it bot
Go to OAuth2
Select generate url
In scopes select bot
In bot perms you can choose any as long as they can send message and ping everyone (If you dont wanna go through all the stuff give the bot adminstrator perms)
Make channels depenending on how many pings you want (I personally recommend 3 because of rate limit)

# Installing discord.py

In your windows search 'command prompt' and run as administrator
Type in 'pip install discord.py'

# Getting the token
Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and click the bot you want to select as ping bot
Then on the left side click Bots
Click the reset token (Make sure it copy it beacuse you are going to need that in order to run the bot)

# How to run the bot
Make a folder if you want
Right-click anywhere > New > TextDocument > You can name it anything you want but make sure you add .py in end (eg: GoDzord.py)
Now right-click the file you just create and select Open with > Notepad (You can also use code editor if you have but wont make any difference)
Dont edit anything in the code! scroll to the bottom and replace TOKEN with the token you copied
Click CTRL+S and you can exit
Double click your python file
Go to the respective channel and type 'start'
Enjoy your pings!
